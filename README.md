## Usage

Note: Replace the `single` command with `hparams` if you want to run hyperparameter optimization.

Note: It may appear that enabling JIT compilation results in a slowdown. If you don't want to run with JIT, then don't pass the XLA flags to the run command.

Note: Our script features very verbose logging to TensorBoard. Enable this by passing `-tb` to the run command.

### CPU

```zsh
TF_XLA_FLAGS="--tf_xla_auto_jit=2 --tf_xla_cpu_global_jit" poetry run python cli.py single
```

### GPU

```zsh
TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_auto_jit=2 poetry run python cli.py single
```
